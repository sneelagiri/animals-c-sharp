# Making Animals with C#

In this project, my goal is to learn more about C# and ASP.NET by working with classes, objects, interfaces, properties, etc. and by using the animal kingdom as a structure/hierarchy to work with.

I made a webpage where you can see names and pictures of a few animals which are contained in an Observable Collection. To see this webpage:

 1. Download the repository
 2. Open the animals-c-sharp.sln file with Visual Studio
 3. Let Visual Studio install the required dependencies
 4. Launch the application

Alternatively, you can:

 1. Download the repository
 2. Navigate to animals-c-sharp\animals-c-sharp\ in your preferred terminal
 3. Run dotnet run

You should see the following:
